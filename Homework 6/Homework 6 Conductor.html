<h3>The Train Conductor</h3>
<p>There was a man who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.
<br>
He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused the train to crash. He made it out, but another person died.
<br>
The driver went to court over the incident. He was found guilty and sentenced to death.
<br>
When the day of the execution arrived, the driver requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flipped, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air … but nothing happened. The man was fine.
<br>
At the time, there was a law that if execution failed it was seen as being divine intervention, so the man was freed.
<br>
Miraculously, he was given back his old job as a train driver.
<br>
Unsurprisingly, he had not learnt from his old ways and was driving with reckless abandon when, again, the train crashed and this time two people were killed.
<br>
At the trial, the man was convicted and sentenced to death. For his final meal, he requested two bananas. After eating them, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flipped, sparks flew, and smoke filled the room … but again, the man was unharmed. He was free to go.
<br>
They were struggling for train drivers, so the man found his old job was still available.
<br>
To the surprise of no one, he crashed another train by being reckless. Three people died this time. The train driver was once again found guilty and sentenced to death.
<br>
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
<br>
“You know what? No,” said the executioner. “I’ve had it with you and your silly bananas and walking out of here unharmed. You’re not getting a thing to eat! We’re doing this now!”
<br>
It was against protocol, but the train driver was strapped to the electric chair without anything to eat. The switch was pulled. sparks flew, and smoke filled the room. When the smoke cleared, the man was revealed to be unharmed. The executioner was speechless.
<br>
The train driver looked at the executioner and said, “Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I’m just a bad conductor.”
